        I met her on the highway at McDonald's;<br>
        I can still recall the Stassin pin she wore;<br>
        She was <b><script>document.write("drinkin'")</script></b> Dr. Pepper by the off-ramp,<br>
            and I knew they'd hate her guts in Baltimore;<br>
        I shrieked in pain I'd warp her mind forever;<br>

        But who'd have thought she'd run off with a robot;<br>
        You'd think at least that she'd have said<b><script>document.write(" goodbye.")</script></b><br>
